# CS210-Portfolio
This is my portfolio for CS 210

## Summarize the project and what problem it is solving
The project I have uploaded is the first project, the Chada Tech Clock. The purpose of this app is to make a clock which displays the time in a 12-hour clock and in a 24-hour clock. It also will allow the user to input an additional hour/minute/second one increment at a time.

## What did you do particularly well?
I think I did well in adding comment lines which helped explain what each part of the program is used for. I also think I did well in creating a loop which allowed the clock to continue adding hours/minutes/seconds until the user wanted to quit.

## Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
I think I could enhance my code by adding checks to make sure that user input is good (i.e. no negative numbers or letters). I also could have made classes or a class out of the functions to help organize the code. I also need to work on testing the code as I go, instead of writing it all out at once and hoping it works.

## Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
The layout of the menu was the most difficult for me, as it is uneven. I plan on adding more resources relevant to coding in C++, such as stackexchange or cplusplus.com in order to learn more about C++.

## What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
This project taught me the most basic skills of C++ which I have had to use in later projects. As such, it provided me an idea of what is expected and what my mindset should be as I tackle these challenges.

## How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
Spacing was most important for me in this project, as I don't like it when it is one long line or one big block. As such, I feel this had made the code more readable. It is also easily adaptable since it is so simple in structure.
